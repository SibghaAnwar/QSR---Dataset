"  Are you scared of me,  I thought you were tired of your business,  Sure I cant twist your arm,  Start off in Madrid Ever been there,  Spain,  Do you blame yourself for helping me,  Were partners,  I never lied to you,  I didnt use you Max,  Theyve confiscated all his other stuff But this ones sorta left over The registrations in the glove box the keys were under the seat Whats a matter havent you ever borrowed someones car,  I told him I might,  Hes on to a new thing Hes after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is woefully and wantonly selling assault rifles to minors He says hes gonna take him down if its the last thing he does,  I saw Ray the other day Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement,  You worked for it  if youre sure thats all you want,  Yeah your fee I had to figure that out since there wasnt no note,  Well we dont let that happen now do we,  Hes already there,  Ordell called and wants to meet me and Im scared,  Ive chickened out Im afraid of him Hell like that,  Tell him I want to give him his money,  Uhhuh,  Get Ordell to come to your office,  It never was so Im not gonna start worrying about it now Look Ray more or less believes my story and he more or less doesnt care All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell,  Thats why ATFs gotta make the case Im their witness They wouldnt have a case without me If its his word against mine who are they gonna believe,  Ray wants him,  Hes liable to shoot you,  How does Winston find him if ATF and all the local Police cant,  Well a suit Theres one I had my eye on,  Thats why you dont make a move till I come out of the fitting room,  Yeah but Im not in jail and I tried,  Not really If he finds it I say Mr Walker put the money in and I didnt know nothing about it Like the coke,  He wont  I mean he didnt the last time Hell be expecting fifty thousand and there it is  on top,  In the bag underneath,  Well you know Im not going to show him the whole amount Hell see fifty thousand,  Dont be so literal Ray believed it,  All he needed was a reasonable explanation,  Oh yeah I got them thinking Ordells real nervous They love thinking hes scared of them,  Thats what you do to go through with the shit you start You rationalize I can do this Max I know I can But I cant do it without you,  It may be evidence once they get their hands on it but right now its only money,  What if Ive figured a way,  If you had a chance unemployed now to walk off with a halfmillion dollars would you take it,  Im not sure you answered my question,  And is that it,  Did you do it that night,  You do that,  What do you do when he comes home,  Wait a minute After we were together you went and snuck into a guys house,  The day you got me out of jail,  When did you decide,  Why,  Youre avoiding the question,  You know where it came from Its not like its anybodys life savings It wouldnt even be missed,  No I mean you right now Not it you were somebody else,  What about you Max,  He tries to act cool,  He werent bullshittin either cause later he was suspended and forced to retire,  Not really But I knew this narcotics cop one time Told me that in a raid the whole package never gets back to the station His exact words,  You dont propose something like that unless youre pretty sure the other persons into it,  Hes setting me up to make a proposition,  Maybe But Im thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself,  I know I got your message Ray wanted to have dinner He wanted to talk about the sting were plotting Thats what he calls it A sting Hes being real nice to me,  Yeah we were goin over everything Thats why all the bags,  Im helping him bring his money into America He loves the idea You just missed him,  Right around here in the food court,  He always just picked it up at my place But with ATF involved I want to stage it You know make it look more intriguing like we know what the fuck were doin Then its up to Ray Nicolet the ATF guy to follow the shopping bag,  Yea but Im going to dress it up Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here,  They seem to like the idea,  I go back to work tomorrow,  How olds Annette,  Why,  Yeah shes the girl who drove the bus in Speed Shes cute,  Who was your girl before Annette,  And Annettes it for you,  Does it happen to all men,  Oh are you Does she know that,  How was it,  Whatd ya see,  I know ignoring me Whatre you up to,  Surprise,  Well Ive flown seven million miles And Ive been waitin on people almost twenty years The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air which is about the worst job you can get in this industry I make about sixteen thousand with retirement benefits aint worth a damn And now with this arrest hanging over my head Im scared If I lose my job I gotta start all over again but I got nothin to start over with Ill be stuck with whatever I can get And that scares me more than Ordell,  I just feel like Im always starting over You said how many bonds you wrote,  Yeah,  My ass aint the same,  Its different with men,  Howd you feel about it,  Really,  Im asking how you feel Does it bother you,  I aint goin to jail and I aint doin that probation thing again,  If I get let off Otherwise fuck em,  Same way I been doin but first they got to let me go back to work,  He needs me Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo Sugar,  We talked,  He came by,  He told me last night,  Its a lot of money About a halfa million dollars All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in,  I want to talk to them first I know more now about Ordells money,  I dont know yet Im going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today Do what you suggested Offer to help and see what happens,  I called in sick this morning As far as the airline knows Im still available,  74 I think,  The Delfonics,  Uhhuh,  I got a few But I cant afford to start all over again I got too much time and money invested in my records,  I couldnt wait till I got home last night and wash my hair,  Yeah,  What I couldnt hear you,  Thanks but I have my own now,  I felt a lot safer having it My milk went bad when I was in jail,  I am Have a seat,  I think maybe I have more options than I thought,  But if all I can give em is Ordells name  I dont really know shit about what he does or how he does it  That dont give me much to bargain with,  Yeah if I cooperate,  Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened This aint solvin my problem I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble Im off today but if I cant leave the country Im out of a job And if I dont got a job I cant hire a lawyer,  Thats it Hes cash poor He kept on me till I finally said okay Ill bring whatever fits in a nineby twelve envelope I got paid five hundred dollars and his friend Mr Walker in Mexico gave me the envelope,  Its all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank But hes got a problem Hes  what do you call it when you got money but dont have cash,  With ten thousand Nine,  I have a pretty good idea Ordell aint no bootlegger and I doubt hes smugglin Cuban cigars So that only leaves one thing an ATF man would be interested in,  It was the other guy who busted me,  Ray Nicolet with Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms,  I didnt,  The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont,  Ordell pick up his bond,  Thats him How do you know em,  Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off Said it was him who told them bout me,  I had em too I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down Then their asses lucked out and found that coke,  Yeah but thats not what this was about They were fuckin waitin for my ass They knew I had that money they even knew the amount The one who searched my bag from LAPD Dargus hardly even looked at it Oh Id say theres fifty thousand here What would you say But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs and I could tell they didnt want to do that,  Sure,  Shit,  So far Ive been told I can cooperate and get probation maybe Or I can stand mute and get as much as five years Does that sound right,  Youre not tired of it,  She was more helpful than the fuckin Public Defender  I dont know  I guess what I need is a lawyer find out what my options are,  Davidoffs I get em in Mexico Theyre hard to find here I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin her boyfriends head open with a baseball bat,  Thats why I dont quit If I cant fly anymore Im gonna have a bitch of a time gettin my brand,  You gain weight,  Cause I look like I just got outta jail thats why You droppin me off at home right Theres a place by me,  That doesnt sound dark,  Is it dark,  Id love one but not there,  Couldnt we just stop at a seven eleven,  I dont think so,  Can we stop for cigarettes,  Who put up my bond Ordell,  Can I see your ID,

I didnt tell him my name I didnt tell him where I was from I didnt tell him what I knew better than to tell him Fuck fifteen minutes ago you almost told me your name You buddy are stuck in a situation you created So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere throw em at a mirror,  And Im very sad about that But some fellas are lucky and some aint,  We aint taking him to a hospital,  Well thats that then I mean I was worried about mug shot possibilities already But now he knows  what you look like  what your first name is  where youre from and  what your specialty is They aint gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out Thats it right you didnt tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection,  One question Do they have a sheet on you where you told him youre from,  Oh I dont doubt is was quite beautiful ,  And what was tellin him your name when you werent supposed to,  Why,  You didnt tell him your name did ya,  Well I guess we drop him off at the hospital Since he dont know nothin about us I say its his decision,  Well Joe aint gettin here Were on our own Now I dont know a goddamn body who can help him so if you know somebody call em,  Assuming we can trust Joe how we gonna get in touch with him Hes supposed to be here but he aint which is making me nervous about being here Even if Joe is on the up and up hes probably not gonna be that happy with us Joe planned a robbery but hes got a blood bath on his hands now Dead cops dead robbers dead civilians Jesus Christ I tend to doubt hes gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight If I was him Id try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible,  You gotta idea spit it out,  Well first things first staying heres goofy We gotta book up,  We cant take him to a hospital,  He scared the fuckin shit outta me I thought he was dead fer sure,  So what is it,  So is he dead or what,  Look asshole Im right Somebodys a fuckin rat How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull,  Now youre using your head For all we know hes the rat,  Oh you and Joe go back a long time I known Joe since I was a kid But me saying Joe definitely couldnt have done it is ridiculous I can say I definitely didnt do it cause I know what I did or didnt do But I cant definitely say that about anybody else cause I dont definitely know For all I know youre the rat,  So whos the rat this time Mr Blue Mr Blonde Joe Its Joes show he set this whole thing up Maybe he set it up to set it up,  No shit,  What,  Then where is everybody I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house We aint got the slightest fuckin idea what happened to Mr Blonde or Mr Blue They could both be dead or arrested They could be sweatin em down at the station house right now Yeah they dont know the names but they can sing about this place I mean that could be happening right now As we speak the cops could be in their cars drivin here this minute,  No theyre not in the car No I dont have them on me Ya wanna go with me and get em Yes we can go right now But first listen to what Im telling you We were fuckin set up Somebody is in league with the cops We got a Judas in our midst And Im thinkin we should have our fuckin heads examined for waiting around here,  I got em all right,  I got the diamonds,  Nope,  Yeah and that was a fucking miracle But if they did get away where the fuck are they,  What do I think I think the cops caught them or killed em,  At that point it became every man for himself As far as Mr Blonde or Mr Blue are concerned I aint got the foggiest Once I got out I never looked back,  Did ya see what happened to anybody else,  I think hes a sick fuckin maniac Were awful goddamn lucky he didnt tag us when he shot up the place I came this fucking close   to taking his ass out myself Everybody panics When things get tense everybody panics Everybody I dont care what your name is you cant help it Its human nature But ya panic on the inside Ya panic in your head Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic then you get a grip and deal with the situation What you dont do is shoot up the place and kill everybody,  I dont wanna kill anybody But if I gotta get out that door and youre standing in my way one way of the other youre gettin outta my way,  Could you believe Mr Blonde,  No real people,  Shot my way out Everybody was shooting so I just blasted my way outta there,  Dont tell me your name I dont want to know I sure as hell aint gonna tell ya mine,  Im telling ya it wasnt that soon They didnt let their presence be known until after Mr Blonde went off Im not sayin they werent there Im sayin they were there But they didnt move in till Mr Blonde became a madman Thats how I know we were set up You can see that cant you Mr White,  The cops didnt show up after the alarm went off They didnt show till after Mr Blonde started shooting everyone,  Thats not correct,  Why not,  Im cool,  What the fuck am I doing here I felt funny about this job right off As soon as I felt it I should said No thank you and walked But I never fucking listen Every time I ever got burned buying weed I always knew the guy wasnt right I just felt it But I wanted to believe him If hes not lyin to me and it really is Thai stick then whoa baby But its never Thai stick And I always said if I felt that way about a job Id walk And I did and I didnt because of fuckin money,  Well you better start thinking about it Cause I sure as fuck am thinking about it In fact thats all Im thinking about I came this close to just driving off Whoever set us up knows about this place There couldve been cops sitting here waiting for me For all we know theres cops driving fast on their way here now,  You even doubt it I dont think we got set up I know we got set up I mean really seriously where did all those cops come from huh One minute theyre not there the next minute theyre there I didnt hear any sirens The alarm went off okay Okay when an alarm goes off you got an average of four minutes response time Unless a patrol car is cruising that street at that particular moment you got four minutes before they can realistically respond In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there All loaded for bear all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all just there Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars Those were the ones responding to the alarm But those other motherfuckers were already there they were waiting for us  You havent thought about this,  This is so fucked

with the wine list these people have We dont want to hold back,  Its not even a mile,  Hey Jack hurry up,  Yeah that would be a good move,  Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities but this ones pretty damn good  This is the new one right Chris,  Now,  Now set your glass down and get some air into it,  Now tip it What youre doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim Tells you how old it is among other things usually more important with reds This is a very young wine so its going to retain its color pretty solidly Now stick your nose in it,  Depends on the varietal Just get a sense of it Thick Thin Watery Syrupy Inky Amber whatever,  First take your glass and examine the wine against the light Youre looking at color and clarity,  Good yeah it is a rose Only this one is rather atypically made from 100 Pinot Noir,  Now were talking,  Doesnt have to be now Lets go taste,  Oh Jesus Look at some point we have to find out because its going to make a big difference,  Yeah but how are they making the salmon Poached with a yogurtdill sauce Teriyaki Curry,  Thanks Jack So do I  Here we are,  I like all varietals I just dont generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California  too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation,  These guys make topnotch Pinot and Chardonnay One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county  Look how beautiful this view is What a day,  You know what Lets take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first,  Jack This week is not about me Its about you Im going to show you a

Dont ask questions like that up in the wine country Theyll think youre a moron,  100 Pinot Noir Single vineyard They dont even make it anymore,  You know how long Ive been begging to take you on the

you bring that up at a time like this,  Youre drunker than I thought  Are you doing that again,  How much wine have you had,   You just got lucky that shes loyal enough to stay with you Maybe shes staying out of pity who knows  She certainly doesnt need you  Some people even say youre holding her back,  Every actor is an invention Viktor  Dont embarrass yourself No ones denying that you discovered Simone  But its like finding a diamond in the desert Anyone can trip over it but its not the finder who sparkles,  You,  Of course she will  Her public will demand it,  But you dont understand  Shell always be there  at some party on some magazine cover some song on the radio up on some screen,  Oh Viktor  You say that now  because were here alone like this  But in the morning youd go back to her  What man wouldnt,  Thats sweet Viktor but I couldnt let you do that  make that kind of sacrifice  Its strange  Ive stabbed people in the back clawed and slept my way to where I am  it goes with the territory  but for some reason I cant betray Simone Theres I dont know any other way to say it  theres a goodness to her,  I want you back too Viktor,   And she was positively glowing at the awards  I should be going shell be here soon ,  I just read somewhere ,  Im sure youll keep her focussed Shes lucky to have you Viktor  Is she really having your baby,  I suppose I could stay just until she arrives,  When is she coming over,  Is it Wednesday  Its Wednesday How embarrassing  I dont know what I was thinking  With all the excitement lately  Am I interrupting something  Are you expecting company,  I can imagine,  Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate,  Its a crowded summer  We need every photoopp soundbyte and column inch we can get  Good night Viktor,  Yes you do  Anyway tonight was a good start,  Whenever I compliment Simone you take the credit,  Viktor do you realize you always do that,  Well yes  From a studio point of view it would be better if Simone stayed single  Anyhow I thought she came across great tonight  Intelligent well informed a natural  And touching She was spectacular,  Are you and Simone   getting married,   Viktor are you with her  Is she there,  Id love to  But arent you supposed to meet up with Simone,  Really,  She was there  She didnt by any chance happen to mention me,  Oh make it live  please Viktor,  Youre so good to protect her like this,  Viktor you should have said something,   I dont think thats necessary I think its perfectly clear  I should have guessed  it all makes sense now its why she never goes anywhere never seen in public,  So the secrets finally out Viktor,   We have to talk to her Viktor,  Thats true,  Everyone I know has met her Viktor,  Id love to tell her myself  When are you going to let me meet her,  Yes  To be honest I never quite saw this film before  maybe its the way Simone is playing it  but what its saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life how thats the only way we can love  I think its really going to mean something,  I should fire you more often  The films looking wonderful,  Maybe youre right  Twelve years after your daughters born you decide to become a father,  Thats genius Viktor  Was that Simones idea,  Viktor I have a feeling  One of my feelings  Theres something about her I dont trust,  Experience Viktor  Ive seen this a hundred times  young stars destroying the very people who discovered them  Im worried about you thats all  This woman  she controls your destiny,  Ill walk you out,  Which accounts for your percentage  When do I get to meet this dream,  Well shoot it on the last day,  Even the fall from the plane,  There isnt one,  Well we have to do something about this  stuntwoman,  Al least a contingency for wardrobe  Any woman can go up a dress size,  She was in the theater  When Where,  Hair and makeup,  Well something has to be done about this budget  Its completely unrealistic  You allowed nothing for limousine service,  Really  Oh so shes really going to do all this nudity,  Whatever  I still havent received Simones script notes,  Viktor we simply have to talk about Eternity,  No problem  Do you want to come in,  Viktor its my studio,  Dont be ridiculous  I arranged a press conference,  Why not,  I cant wait to meet her,  I dont have it on me  Anyway it means a lot  Have you read the reviews  Theyre love letters  Listen to this one  Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda the body of Sophia Loren the grace of well Grace Kelley and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel,  Viktor I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio,  Why isnt she with you,  Even if you find her you know the problem with unknowns Viktor  If theyre good they get known  And then youre back to sorting their candy and worse  Im sorry Viktor,  Theyre yours  But how are you going to finish it  Without a star theres no movie,  The pictures dead,  How can I  Your last three pictures tanked  The board is giving me hell  No bankable star will work with you after this  If you just compromised a little,   Christ Viktor look around What do you think pays for all this  This is about investment and return  Those days in New York thats its over,  Listen Viktor I have good memories of those days too  but this isnt about that or you or me or some highminded ideal  This is business,   Its called a projector,  You realize youre nostalgic for an era you werent even born in,  Its the truth  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy  We cant open  cant make a profit without them,  The public decides whos on that list,   Whats wrong with that,   I have a feeling youre going to tell me,   Viktor that was Short Subject,  Hmm Mike and Ikes,  Excuse us",family,Consanguine

kind to me She told me I was beautiful,  I dont know,  No do you,  Well I think they come from angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear That makes good babies start to grow And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there and they start to grow grow till they come out down there I dont know where good babies come out And you cant tell the difference except bad babies cry a lot and they make their fathers go away and their mothers get very ill die sometimes,  Where do you think babies come from,  One,  No questions,  Why do you smoke,  Why not,  Would

left it with them but it was such a difficult birth there was so much blood and I panicked,  No,  I didnt hide it I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets,  Thats a lie,  She didnt want any help,  The scandal,  I dont know too late to stop it,  Oh dont be ridiculous,  I didnt guess until it was too late,  Yes,  Is it because shes a nun,  Why do you insist upon pressing,  My God but youre determined,  Hasnt she had enough,  If you believe this is murder it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to not me And definitely not Agnes,  Im concerned about her health,  Why would I lie,  Who  That tun that tunnel hasnt been used in fifty years,  Thats crazy How could she find out about it,  Then why are you so obsessed with her Youre losing sleep over her  Youre thinking about her all the time Youre bent on saving her Why,  Thats what you believe she is  The sum of her psychological parts,  She is an innocent,  But I want the opportunity to believe I want the choice to believe,  Youll never find the answer for everything God did,  There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out,  A miracle is an event without an explanation If shes capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail why couldnt she split a cell in her womb,  Dont be ridiculous,  Stop laughing I dont say its the truth Im saying,  Why must he be anybody,  The father,  Shes been touched by God yes,  For Agnes,  One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect,  If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes well find our own thank you ,  Ive just met with the bishop Were taking you off the case,  Then lets begin,  May I be present,  Would it stop you if I did,  Begin what,  Listen to her singing,  Yes but goodness has very little to do with it Not all the saints were good in fact some of them were a little crazy But they were still attached to God Agnes has that birth  No more were born we live we die No room for miracles  Oh my dear how I miss the miracles,  Become  One is born a saint,  Yes I do,  There are no saints today Good people yes but extraordinarily good people those Im afraid we are sorely lacking,  And Saint John would chew tobacco,  Mary Magdelen,  Pipe,  Even Christ would partake socially,  Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet  And of course ,  Undoubtedly Not the ascetics of course but well Saint Thomas More,  Fine thanks,  Id love one,  No it reminds me,  So you left the Church because you had freckles,  And what has that to do with it,  Stupid woman and thats all,  What have we done to hurt you  And dont deny it I can smell an exCatholic a mile away What did we do  Burn a few heretics sell some indulgences That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body We let governments do those things today So what did we do to you eh  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldnt because it was a sin,  What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you,  Who said anything about the Catholic Church,  Bullshit yourself,  Because I am a moral person,  Shes happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone,  I know you dont,  Her spiritual health,  I havent decided yet,  Well see about that,  And my permission,  Because I didnt know ,  I knew that after the fact,  Oh God if only Id known,  Oh dear God,  I dont think I care to know,  She drank too much Thats what killed her,  Yes,  I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent My sister ran away from home We lost touch with her And when my husband died and I came here she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened,  I didnt tell you because I didnt think it was important,  About what,  Yes I dont remember where Agnes was I was needed in the sick room,  The twenty third of January On that night one of our elder nuns passed away,  Oh Dear God I should have guessed,  The sheets,  Oh Dear God,  Theres nothing here,  Yes,  Nothing,  Earthquakes,  Oh some time in January,  All right what do you need,  How,  What,  What good would it do No matter what you decide its either the the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin,  I am,  I am not a virgin Doctor I was married for twenty three years two daughters I even have grandchildren surprised It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother My children wont even see me any more thats their revenge I think they tell their friends that Ive passed on And dont tell me Im making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud ,    ,  She is not a child,  Im only interested,  Its my affair too,  Catholicism is not on trial here I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else,  The Catholic Church,  Nuns you hate nuns,  You hate us dont you,  Gods victim Thats her innocence She belongs to God,  I saw it Clean through the palm of her hand Do you think hysteria could do that,  I know what youre thinking shes a hysteric pure and simple,  But she didnt did she If anyone had seen what Id seen shed be public property newspapermen psychiatrists ridicule She doesnt deserve that,  It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again,  About two years before,  She stopped eating completely,  I was appalled just as you are now,  Shortly after she came to us,  Oh come on youve talked to her She doesnt even know how babies are born let alone made,  Noone knew about Agnes pregnancy Noone Not even Agnes,  Thats absurd,  Who,  You dont really believe something like that happened do you,  Ive already told you what I thought,  No not in the eyes of the police,  She didnt  This is manslaughter not murder She didnt consciously kill that baby Shed lost a lot of blood She was unconscious by the time we got to her,  In her case it isnt Shes had very little schooling Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here to us Shes never been out there Doctor Shes never seen a movie or a television show Shes never even read a book,  Because shes an innocent Shes a slate thats hasnt been touched except by God,  From other people  I believe she is not crazy nor is she lying,  I believe Agnes is different,  And I am not from the Middle Ages I know what you are  I dont want that mind cut open,  Exactly I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible She wont hold up under any sort of cross examination,  Look doctor I dont know how to tell you this politely but I dont approve of you Not you personally,  Dont ask me those questions dear Im not the patient,  Yes but that was some ten months ago I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial,  She cant even remember the birth Do you think shed admit to the conception,  Believe me Ive done everything possible short of asking Agnes,  Obviously there was,  Father Martineau but I dont see him as a candidate,  Yes but I,  None as far as I know,  I havent a clue,  Were examined once a year Her pregnancy fell in between the doctors visits,  She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to,  Yes,  She undressed alone she bathed alone,  Noone,  Unfiltered,  Two packs a day,  You must have tons of questions You may smoke if you

"  The Orpheum,  But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with So dont mention anything about time travel to anyone,  According to your girlfriend Suzy Parker you and she were at the movies You went to the restroom and you never came out Obviously you stepped through an interdimensional time warp created by the original operation of the time machine,  A car,  1982 March 18 just like we planned My calculations were absolutely correct Thirty years God I cannot believe its been thirty years Sure it was a long time ago  longest Ive ever had to wait for the results of an experiment,  Professor Brown grinned I guess Ill see you in about 30 years,  Were at one and a half miles so youre just a little over a mile from where you want to be  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go  that should give you plenty of time and it should be close enough to zero hour that they cant do anything to stop you Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri the time chamber Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bombthe power converter will do the rest,  Curious  Very curious,  It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future theoretically it could happen at the moment of your birthor conception Actually it could happen at any time Its a question to which I hope well never learn the answer,  Theres no way of knowing,  Itll be fine Marty  Youll be fine Good luck He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it But there was still a question that was nagging at him,  Look Marty shes not your mother yet And if you dont go through with this she may never be I know its hard but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant Some choices must be made that are difficult Nonetheless we must make them Besides this may be more than a simple question of your own existence he added The fate of the entire spacetime continuum may rest on your shoulders  Marty tried to smile at him,  Nobody said anything about hitting her Youre just going to take a few liberties with her,  Good Professor Brown tested the tarp noting in satisfaction that it was secure Ill pick you up in front of the school at midnight Dont be late  were cutting it close as it is Weve got a long drive ahead of us,  In a manner of speaking yes And because of that shes no longer interested in your father,  Apparently what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mothers emotional behavior,  My guess is that she turned him down,  Your mother wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday shes available,  The test is this Monday 15 megatons Lets see we need 4200 rads  Youd have to beexactly 800 yards from ground zero You realize that what were going to do could be extremely dangerous,  You better make sure your old man asks her out because if he doesnt they may never have a first date And if they dont have a first date they wont have a second date If they dont have a second date they wont fall in love If they dont fall in love they wont get married and if they dont get married youll never be born,  You did what,  Curious Very curious,  I dont recall ever seeing it before,  You forget  time travel is instantaneous The time machine would melt but you would have already travelled through time Of course its a moot point regardless The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Armys Nevada Test Site and those tests are kept absolutely top secret,  I am serious If we could get you the time machine and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast we could send you back to the future,  An atomic bomb,  I dont know but I dont want to take any chances Now you stay here and dont do anything Dont answer the door dont answer the phone dont go outside Understand,  Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history Dont you understand The fabric of history is very delicate Anything you do could have serious consequences,  I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time Nobodys supposed to see you here What if I was a mailman Or a salesman,  You answered the door,  We dont,  Just a guess I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982,  Blast it  no I suppose youre right You do know the proper chemical formula,  Of course The power converter It works Of course it works  What chemicals do we use,  On second thought there may be some things youll have to tell me,  No Dont tell me  I dont want to know the future My knowledge of future events your mere presence here could have devastating effects on the course of history And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear My immediate response is to send you back to your own time,  Youve convinced me that you must be who you say you are No living human has ever seen this machine  But why Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time,  A mall,  Must have been Used to live I do live here,  Uh Marty Lewis I almost didnt recognize him  havent seen him in years,  Ssshhhhh,  You know me,  The future Marty the future is everything I built this machine to see the future So I am going to send Shemp twentyfour hours into the future You can assist me if you like,  Dont you understand The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear,  Marty that would alter history,  A gold mine,  Of course Shemp is unaware that anything even happened other than his stool suddenly falling over We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him but for
